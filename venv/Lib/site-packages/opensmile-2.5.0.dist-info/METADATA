        This audEERING Research License Agreement (license, license agreement, 
        or agreement in the ongoing), is a legal agreement between you 
        and audEERING GmbH, Gilching, Germany (audEERING or we in the following) 
        for the software or data identified above, which may include source code, 
        and any associated materials, text or speech files, 
        associated media and "online" or electronic documentation 
        (together, the "Software").  
        
        By installing, copying, or otherwise using this Software, 
        you agree to be bound by the terms in this license. 
        If you do not agree, you may not install, copy or use the Software. 
        The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual 
        property laws and is licensed, not sold.
        
        This license grants you the following rights:
        A. You may use, copy, reproduce, and distribute this Software 
           for any non-commercial purpose, subject to the restrictions 
           set out below. Some purposes which can be non-commercial are teaching, 
           academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation 
           or personal home use. You may also distribute this Software with 
           books or other teaching materials, or publish the Software on websites, 
           that are intended to teach the use of the Software for academic or 
           other non-commercial purposes. 
           You may NOT use or distribute this Software or any derivative works 
           in any form for commercial purposes, except those outlined in (B). 
           Examples of commercial purposes are running business operations, 
           licensing, leasing, or selling the Software, distributing the 
           Software for use with commercial products (no matter whether free or paid), 
           using the Software in the creation or use of commercial products or any 
           other activity which purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or 
           others (except for conditions set out in (B)).
        B. Further, you may use the software for commercial research, which meets
           the following conditions: commercial research which is not directly
           associated with product development and has the primary purpose of 
           publishing and sharing results with the academic world; pre-product 
           evaluations of algorithms and methods, as long as these evaluations
           are more of an evaluatory, planning, and research nature than 
           of a product development nature. 
           Any further commercial use requires you to obtain a commercial
           license or written approval from audEERING GmbH which grants
           you extended usage rights for this software. In particular any direct 
           (software) or indirect (models, features extracted with the software)
           use of the software, parts of the software, or derivatives in a 
           product (no matter whether free or paid), is not allowed without 
           an additional commercial license.
        C. If the software includes source code or data, you may create 
           derivative works of such portions of the software and distribute the 
           modified software for non-commercial purposes, as provided herein.
           If you distribute the software or any derivative works of the Software, 
           you must distribute them under the same terms and conditions as in this
           license, and you must not grant other rights to the software or 
           derivative works that are different from those provided by this 
           license agreement. 
           If you have created derivative works of the software, and distribute 
           such derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry 
           prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving 
           the original software. Such notices must state: 
           (i) that you have altered the software; 
           and (ii) the date of any changes as well as your name.
        
        In return for the above rights, you agree:
        1. That you will not remove any copyright or other notices (authors 
           and citing information, for example) from the software.
        2. That if any of the software is in binary format, you will not attempt 
           to modify such portions of the software, or to reverse engineer or 
           decompile them, except and only to the extent authorized by applicable 
           law. 
        3. That the copyright holders (audEERING) are granted back, 
           without any restrictions or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual,

           distribute, make and have made, sell and transfer your modifications 
           to and/or derivative works of the software source code or data, 
           for any purpose.  
        4. That any feedback about the software provided by you to us is voluntarily 
           given, and audEERING shall be free to use the feedback 
           as they see fit without obligation or restriction of any kind, 
           even if the feedback is designated by you as confidential. 
        
        5. THAT THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. 
           THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING 
           WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR 
           ENJOYMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        6. THAT NEITHER AUDEERING NOR ANY AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE 
           SOFTWARE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS 
           LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL 
           DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT LEGAL 
           THEORY IT IS BASED ON. ALSO, YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
           ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
           
        7. That we have no duty of reasonable care or lack of negligence, 
           and we are not obligated to (and will not) provide technical support for 
           the Software.
        8. That if you breach this license agreement or if you sue anyone over 
           patents that you think may apply to or read on the software or anyone's 
           use of the software, this license agreement (and your license and rights 
           obtained herein) terminate automatically. Upon any such termination,

           Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 of this license agreement shall survive 
           any termination of this license agreement.
        9. That the patent rights, if any, granted to you in this license agreement 
           only apply to the software, not to any derivative works you make.
        10.That the software may be subject to European export or import laws or such 
           laws in other places. You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations 
           that may apply to the software after the delivery of the software to you.
        11.That all rights not expressly granted to you in this license agreement 
           are reserved by audEERING.
        12.That this license agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws

           If any provision of this license agreement shall be deemed unenforceable 
           or contrary to law, the rest of this license agreement shall remain in 
           full effect and interpreted in an enforceable manner that most closely 
           captures the intent of the original language.

Python interface for extracting openSMILE_ features.

.. code-block::

    $ pip install opensmile

.. note:: Only 64-bit Python is supported.

Feature sets
------------

Currently, three standard sets are supported.
`ComParE 2016`_ is the largest with more than 6k features.
The smaller sets GeMAPS_ and  eGeMAPS_
come in variants ``v01a``, ``v01b`` and ``v02`` (only eGeMAPS_).
We suggest to use the latest version
unless backward compatibility with
the original papers is desired.

Each feature set can be extracted on two levels:

* Low-level descriptors (LDD)
* Functionals

For `ComParE 2016`_ a third level is available:

* LLD deltas

.. note:: Pre v2.0.0 some LLDs of the GeMAPS family were incorrectly output
    as deltas. This was corrected with v2.0.0 and these features are now
    correctly returned as LLDs. Note that with v2.0.0 deltas are no
    longer available for the GeMAPS family.

The following table lists the number of features
for each set and level.

With v2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~

============  ==============
Name          #features
============  ==============
ComParE_2016  65 / 65 / 6373
GeMAPSv01a    18 / - / 62
GeMAPSv01b    18 / - / 62
eGeMAPSv01a   23 / - / 88
eGeMAPSv01b   23 / - / 88
eGeMAPSv02    25 / - / 88
============  ==============

.. note:: Additional feature sets have been added by the community.
    For a full list please see the documentation of ``opensmile.FeatureSet``.

Pre v2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~

============  ==============
Name          #features
============  ==============
ComParE_2016  65 / 65 / 6373
GeMAPSv01a    5 / 13 / 62
GeMAPSv01b    5 / 13 / 62
eGeMAPSv01a   10 / 13 / 88
eGeMAPSv01b   10 / 13 / 88
============  ==============

Code example
------------

Code example,
that extracts `ComParE 2016`_  functionals from an audio file:

.. code-block:: python

    import opensmile

    smile = opensmile.Smile(
        feature_set=opensmile.FeatureSet.ComParE_2016,
        feature_level=opensmile.FeatureLevel.Functionals,
    )
    y = smile.process_file('audio.wav')
